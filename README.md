#**_My First Repository_**

Here's my first task as an ALX student in cohort_3

##**_The Steps_**

The project on my computer was added to Github through my Gitbash command line.

On my computer's gitbash, I created a directory **_alx-pre_course_**, initilaize my repository and added a README.md file.

Through the git commands, I was able to push my project to the remote server.
